        <h1>EDUCATION</h1>
    <p> I have been to quiet a few schools during my schooling period. I have been to 3 schools i.e. Emile Academy, Namuna Secondary School and GEMS School.
    </p>
    <h2>EMILE ACADEMY</h2>
    <p>This was one of my first school as far as i can remember. I studied here from U.K.G to grade 3.
        The school was close to my home and I used to go there with my father and my sister sometimes.
        Then later we had to shift places and I had to leave the school becasue of  the distance between my new house and my school.
    </p>
    <h2>NAMUNA ACADEMY</h2>
    <p>Here I studied my remaining time of grade 3. This school was near my house and it was easy acces from my house. I studied here also while I prepared for my entrane examination at GEMS School where I completed my schooling.</p>
    <h2>GEMS School</h2>
    <p>This was my first time in a big school. GEMS had big building and was spreaded in a huge space, in my first day it took me 10 mins to find my class and I almost got lost in the school premises. I studied here from 2014 to 2020 i.e from grade 4 to 10.I learned a lot and gave a lot to GEMS school and passed with flying color.
    </p>
    <h2>Uniglobe SS/College</h2>
    <p>This was the college where I did my +2 or say highschooling. Most of the time of our +2 education was online since I started my college in starting of 2020 and it was till 2022 hence most was spent online. However the time we had our classes physically I managed to take the most of it.</p>
    <h2>Herald College Kathmandu</h2>
    <p>Herald College is where I am currently doing my bachelors degree in computer science. I will be studying here from 2022 to 2025. This was where I wanted to study when I planned on styding IT deu to the environment and everything here.</p>
