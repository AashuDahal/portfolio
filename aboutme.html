  <h1>MY STORY</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I was born in a Patan Hospital and I lived most of my childhood in rental home and shifted to my now residing place Changathali,Lalipur. 
    This place has a lot of my memories good and bad. I had to change schools and alter my <a href="education.html">education</a>.
    As mentioned above I was exposed to IT field from a very young age as my dad my brothers all were somewhat from the IT sectors.
    This peaked a interest in me which led me to choose IT sector for my further education. 
    During my schooling I started doing sketching and arts which made me keen on doing professional skethcing and won a prize in it but further down the line I negleted it as basketball peaked my interest and is my passion along side IT.
    Deu to my current passion I am studying my bachelor's in HCK.
    I have not achieved many great things till now I have won few intra school prizes but I aspire to achive many great things now and work my way up for a good future.
    I have done some <a href="programs.html"></a>programs and projects in HCK. These are small and begginer level programming. However I aspire to do more of it.</p>
